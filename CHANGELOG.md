All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **YAML Generator: Hub-level sensor output format** ([#4](https://github.com/RAR/esphome-tigomonitor/issues/4))
  - YAML config page (`/yaml`) was generating hub-level sensors in a nested sub-key format (`power_sum:`, `energy_sum:`, etc.) under a single platform entry, which is invalid
  - Hub sensors now correctly generate as separate `- platform: tigo_monitor` entries with keyword-rich names that match the sensor type auto-detection in `sensor.py`
  - Names updated to use proper keywords: "Total System Power", "Total System Energy", "Active Device Count", etc.

### Changed
- **Documentation: Quick Start overhaul** ([#3](https://github.com/RAR/esphome-tigomonitor/issues/3))
  - `external_components` now uses expanded `type: git` / `url:` format instead of shorthand `github://` which may not resolve correctly
  - Board changed from `esp32dev` to `esp32-s3-devkitc-1` (generic ESP32-S3)
  - Added `logger:` to base config
  - Added required empty `sensor:`, `text_sensor:`, `binary_sensor:` stub sections with explanation — without these, compilation fails due to missing generated headers
  - Added generic ESP32-S3 PSRAM config example alongside existing M5Stack example
  - Added PSRAM bootloader gotcha: must clean build + erase flash when switching from non-PSRAM to PSRAM config
- **Documentation: Expanded system-level sensor reference** in `CONFIGURATION.md`
  - Added all 9 hub-level sensor types with complete YAML examples (was only showing 4)
  - Documented full keyword list for each sensor type including all accepted synonyms
  - Added note clarifying that hub sensors must each be their own platform entry
- **Troubleshooting: New sections**
  - Added fix for `fatal error: sensor/sensor.h: No such file or directory` compile error
  - Added `external_components` loading troubleshooting with correct format examples
  - Added PSRAM not detected after enabling (bootloader rebuild required)

## [1.3.1] - 2025-12-03

### Fixed
- **Night Mode Display Issues**
  - Dashboard API now returns zero watts during night mode instead of residual cached power
  - Cached total power properly zeroed when all devices go offline
- **Daily Energy Tracking**
  - Fixed race condition between `update_daily_energy()` and `check_midnight_reset()` archival

  - Optimized `load_peak_power_data()`: Eliminate temporary string allocations
  - Optimized `save_node_table()`: Reuse string buffer for preference keys
  - Optimized `load_node_table()`: Reuse string buffer for preference keys
  - Root cause: `std::string pref_key = "peak_" + device.addr` created 30+ allocations per reset
  - Solution: Static string buffer with reserve(32), reuse with `pref_key = "peak_"; pref_key += device.addr`
  - Eliminates heap fragmentation from alloc/free cycles
  - Zero heap allocations per iteration after first call

### Changed
- **UART Processing Optimization**

  - Example: "Packet missed! Found END before START (buffer: 14 bytes, available: 68)"
  - Helps diagnose buffer overflow vs. bus collision
- **Packet Statistics Tracking**
  - Added `total_frames_processed_` counter
  - Incremented in `process_frame()` for every successful frame
  - Enables miss rate calculation: `(missed / (total + missed)) × 100`
  - Periodic logging every 60 seconds with heap stats

### Performance
- **Display Lambda Optimization**
  - Before: 5-10ms CPU time per update (device iteration + calculations)
  - After: <0.5ms CPU time per update (3 getter calls + rendering)
  - 90%+ reduction in display CPU overhead
  - Eliminated allocation of Color() objects in lambda
  - No more string formatting or power calculations during display
- **Memory Leak Resolution**
  - Before: ~2KB RAM loss every midnight reset
  - After: Zero measurable RAM loss at midnight
  - Improved long-term stability for 24/7 operation
- **Packet Reception Performance**
  - Measured: 0.02-0.04% miss rate (99.96-99.98% success)
  - ~60,000 frames processed per hour with 30 devices
  - Missed packets occur in synchronized bursts (bus collisions)
  - Performance near theoretical maximum for multi-drop RS485

  - Both functions process hundreds of frames per hour
  - Fixes gradual heap exhaustion even without web UI usage
  - Stable memory usage over long-term operation
- **CCA Data Persistence Bug**
  - Fixed `load_node_table()` not loading CCA data after frame09_barcode removal

### Changed
- **PSRAM Optimization for Frame Processing**
  - `frame_to_hex_string()` now uses `psram_string` internally (saves 1-3KB per frame)
  - `remove_escape_sequences()` now uses `psram_string` internally (saves 500-1500 bytes per frame)
  - Combined savings: 3-5KB internal RAM per frame processed
  - Conditional compilation: PSRAM path on ESP-IDF, original code on other platforms
  - Preserves internal RAM for critical operations
- **Enhanced Memory Logging**
  - Added more detailed logging for CCA data loading
  - Improved diagnostic messages for node table restoration
  - Better tracking of memory usage patterns

### Technical Details
- Memory leak fixes eliminate continuous heap fragmentation
- PSRAM optimizations reduce internal RAM pressure by 3-5KB per frame
- Frame processing functions handle thousands of frames per day
- `push_back()` with `reserve()` provides single allocation vs repeated allocations with `+=`
- PSRAM access ~4x slower but negligible impact (microseconds) vs memory benefits
- All optimizations maintain backward compatibility

### Performance Impact
- **Stable heap usage**: No more gradual memory exhaustion
- **Reduced fragmentation**: Internal RAM allocations eliminated for large buffers
- **Long-term reliability**: Systems can run indefinitely without memory issues
- **PSRAM utilization**: Large temporary buffers now in PSRAM instead of internal RAM

2. Memory monitoring sensors are optional but recommended for diagnostics
3. No configuration changes required for bug fixes
